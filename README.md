# Big-Numbers-Algorithm
Algorithm which gets two arrays of chars that represent two big numbers( {'1','2','3'} =123), add or substract they binary and display the result in chosen binary number system (2-16).

In this project I could use only variables, arrays,loops, binary operations (for adding and substracting) and conditional statements.
