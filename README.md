# Big-Numbers-Algorithm
Algorithm which gets two arrays of chars that represent two big numbers( {'1','2','3'} =123), add or substract they binary and display the result in chosen binary number system (2-16).

The "calc" method gets two arrays of chars (two numbers), char '+' or '-' (wanted binary operation), and integer (2-16) which represents binary number system.
This is a student project and I could use only variables, arrays,loops, binary operations (for adding and substracting) and conditional statements.
